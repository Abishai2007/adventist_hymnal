# Adventist Hymnal - MediaShout Format

Adventist Hymnal Text in MediaShout format for import on Proclaim presentations software.
The spelling of the text is Australian English.

The project has been divided in three folders corresponding with Public Domain, Copyrighted by CCLI, and Projection not permitted lyrics. See https://corporate.adventistchurch.com/music-copyright/ for more information.

There is a variation from MediaShout in that stanzas are formatted  [Verse #] rather than Verse #: See http://www.mediashout.com/guide/prepare-a-lyric-text-file-for-import
